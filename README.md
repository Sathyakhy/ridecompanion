MVP (Version 1)

If you're building this yourself, I'd keep the first version very small:

✅ Bike profile
✅ Maintenance logs
✅ Cost tracking
✅ Service reminders based on mileage
✅ Dashboard showing monthly and yearly costs

Everything else (fuel tracking, receipts, analytics, notifications) can be added later.

A React + Power Apps + Dataverse solution would work very well for this and could be built in just a few tables with a clean mobile-friendly interface.

This project was built with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev).

**Live app**: https://ridecompanion.lovable.app

## Build with Lovable

Continue developing this project in the [Lovable editor](https://lovable.dev/projects/6a201fe1-1556-4987-af9e-0b6b8a7fbd6c).

- **Ship faster**: describe what you want to build and Lovable handles the code.
- **Stay in sync**: every change made in Lovable is committed straight to this repository.
- **Full ownership**: this code is yours. Push to `main` on GitHub and your changes sync back into Lovable, ready for your next prompt.

## Development

Prefer working locally? You need Node.js and npm — [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

```sh
git clone <this-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm i
npm run dev
```
